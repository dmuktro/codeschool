// The Hoover Dam has 19 generators of multiple types. For simplicity, let’s say that the first 4 of these generators output 62 megawatts, and the other 15 output 124 megawatts. In hooverDam.js, the Dam Rangers have asked you to design a system of two loops that turns each generator on in progression, and prints the new total of megawatts generated.
// They’d like the first loop to be a while loop handling the first 4 generators. Then, they’d like the second loop to be a for loop that handles the other 15 generators. Each output line should resemble the following lines, with adjusted values for the currentGen and totalMW:
//   Generator #1 is on, adding 62 MW, for a total of 62 MW!
//   Generator #2 is on, adding 62 MW, for a total of 124 MW!
